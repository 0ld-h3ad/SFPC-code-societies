1. Definition of ideology (Marx)
  * Reproduction of labor & relations
    * Reproductive labor
    * Labor force learns know-how, and they are all destined for a specific role, they learn to respect discipline and the division of labor. They learn the “rules”
    * They must not only reproduce labor, they must reproduce submission to “the rules” through false consciousness.
  * Infrastructure/Superstructure
    * Infrastructure—economic base: produces unity of productive forces and relations of production
    * Superstructure—two levels: law and state; ideology (different ideologies, religious, ethical, legal, political, etc.)
  * Determinism
    * Base determines superstructure.
    * Ideology is a projection of the consciousness of the ruling class.
    * Superstructure is either autonomous or reciprocal to the base.
    * Althusser says enacting the belief creates the belief. “Kneel and pray and then you will believe”
    * Zizek - “Ideology persists in one’s actions rather than in one’s beliefs” (Chun, 44)
  * Hegemony (Gramsci)
  * Pervert’s Guide to Ideology
  * The Matrix: Red Pill
